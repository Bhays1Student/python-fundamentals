# About Me

Hi!  My name is Benjamin, and I am a 20 year old from Kansas.  I am a new to programming so I'm sure it will take time to get adjusted, but I will do everything in my power to work hard and learn quickly.  Thank you!

This is the first programming language that we are going to work with in our Cloud Development Course.
